## Welcome to the GitHub profile of the Countoscope 

The original code used in our Countoscope manuscript can be found in this [Repository](https://github.com/Countoscope/countoscope_PRX). 

We are currently working on an updated, more versatile and more robust, version of the code which you can access as a beta, through the [Python code](https://github.com/Countoscope/countoscope), some sample [trajectories](https://github.com/Countoscope/datasets), and the [source code](https://github.com/Countoscope/countoscope.github.io) of the [documentation](https://countoscope.github.io/).
